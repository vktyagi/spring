This is a short manual for using/working with security.
1. Create a java keystore, type must jceks.
1.1 You can use java keytool which comes with JDK or any available keytool GUI applications.
1.2 Remember the keystore password!

2. Select value for KEY_ALIAS_NAME, for example
	KEY_ALIAS_NAME = "secret_key";

3. You can use KeyStoreUtilsApp.java to generate encrypted messages for your plain text messages.
3.1 Just remember, to decrypt encoded messages you must use the same keystore/keystore password/alias key or you  will get an exception or decrypted value would be wrong!

4. Created a new application demo: KeyStoreUtilsAppForKeyEncryption (java file) which take a properties file (app-template.properties) and encrypt values in the properties file
 for given alias (specified in properties file) and write to new property file (app-template-enc.properties).
